## About Me

I am a New Englander at heart even though I now live and work in Wichita, KS.  I have had a variety of experience ranging from Supply Chain and Logistics to Staffing to Manufacturing High-end products.  I would have never seen myself in any of these positions but am greatful for where I have been taken.  I learned started learning Engineering while in Highschool in a Vocational Tech school but while that was Mechanically focused I did not pursue that in College and upon graduation decided to pickup engineering again but in a digital sense.

I self taught myself to learn Java, Apex, JavaScript, Python and all their surrounding technologies.  This slowly evolved into a love and passion for Web Tech be it React, React-Native, Electron, or WebAssembly.  I have been passionately pursuing more knowledge and ways to expand my ability to write clean code once that will do what it looks like it should be doing.
